					<div class="col-12">
						LexTALE stands for Lexical Test for Advanced Learners of English. It is intended for cognitive researchers studying participants with an advanced level of English as a second language in an experimental setting.
					</div> <br>
					<h5 class="bld">What is it ? </h5>
					<div class="col-12">
						The LexTALE is a quick and practically feasible test of vocabulary knowledge for medium to highly proficient speakers of English as a second language. It consists of a simple un-speeded visual lexical decision task. In contrast to other vocabulary or proficiency tests, it has been designed to meet the needs of cognitive researchers. It is quick, easy to administer, and free, and yet it is a valid and standardized test of vocabulary knowledge. It has also been shown to give a fair indication of general English proficiency.
					</div> <br>
					<h5 class="bld">Quick and Easy</h5>
					<div class="col-12">
						On average, the LexTALE takes about 3.5 minutes to complete. It comprises only 60 trials, making it a practically feasible addition to any psycholinguistic experiment. <br> 
						The LexTALE can either be administered online, or implemented in any experimental software (download the item list and instructions for implementation). The LexTALE can also be downloaded in Praat, Presentation, and Matlab format.
					</div> <br>
					<h5 class="bld">Valid</h5>
					<div class="col-12">
						In a large-scale study (Lemh√∂fer & Broersma, 2012 ) on Dutch and Korean advanced learners of English, the LexTALE was evaluated 1) as a measure of English vocabulary knowledge, 2) as an indicator of general English proficiency, and 3) as an indicator of performance on two psycholinguistic experimental paradigms. LexTALE scores were found to be good predictors of vocabulary knowledge (as measured by L1-L2 and L2-L1 translation), to give a fair indication of general English proficiency (as measured by two thorough and extensive proficiency tests, the TOEIC and the Quick Placement Test), and to correlate well with experimental word recognition data (from lexical decision and progressive demasking experiments). See Validity for more information about LexTALE in relation to other tests.
